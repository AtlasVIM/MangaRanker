# Manga Ranker React Project
This is a solo project done in React JS within only 2 days.
It functions as an organizer of your manga reading list from your favourite to least favourite.
There's still a few improvements to be made but I'm already very satisfied with how it is currently.


## APIs Used
This program uses the Kitsu API in order to fetch manga titles, images and ids. 

## Functions
All the list entries are draggable and their ranking changes whenever you sort them.
You can add and delete entries to your list and they persist within your browser's local storage, meaning they persist even if you close of refresh the page.
You can download and upload a JSON file with your entries, this serves as a backup in case you browser's local storage is emptied.

## Issues & Improvements to be made
It could be a bit more performant, but it runs well enough.
Still need to better the styling a little bit.
File uploading needs some validation in case someone uploads the wrong file.
